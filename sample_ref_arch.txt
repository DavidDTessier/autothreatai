System Architecture:
- Client: Web Browser / Mobile App
- CDN: Cloudflare (WAF/DDoS protection)
- Load Balancer: Nginx (HTTPS Termination)
- Auth Service: Keycloak (OIDC/OAuth2)
- App Server: Python FastAPI (Microservices)
- Background Tasks: Celery / RabbitMQ
- Primary Database: MySQL 8.0 (Encrypted at rest)
- Cache/Session: Redis Cluster
- File Storage: AWS S3 (Private buckets)
- Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Monitoring: Prometheus / Grafana

Data Flow:
1. User requests routed through Cloudflare CDN to Nginx.
2. Nginx validates SSL and forwards to FastAPI.
3. FastAPI authenticates via Keycloak.
4. FastAPI reads/writes to MySQL and Redis.
5. Async tasks pushed to RabbitMQ for processing by Celery.
6. Files uploaded directly to S3 via pre-signed URLs.
7. System logs shipped to ELK; Metrics scraped by Prometheus.
Trust Boundaries:
- Boundary A: Public Internet vs. WAF/CDN
- Boundary B: DMZ (Nginx/WAF) vs. Internal Network
- Boundary C: Internal Application Layer vs. Data Layer (MySQL/S3/Redis)
